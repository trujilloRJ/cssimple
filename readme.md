# Welcome to CSSimple!
**CSSimple** is a *utility-first*, *responsive*, *unopinionated*, and *open-source* css framework. Some of its features are:
* Responsive **flexbox grid**
* **Light-weight** framework
* Easily modifiable using **sass**
* Easy to learn (**semantic classes**)

It was written using sass and was designed to be easily modifiable through it, instead of using the compiled css. Everything is configurable through the **_config.scss** file. Finally, this is an open-source project, so contributions and comments are very welcome!
